## 👋 
Hi, I'm Antoine!
I am currently `#OpenToWork`!

## 💼👨‍💻
As a versatile **full-stack engineer**, I am looking for a role that can benefit from a **global vision** of the project, as well as a **deep understanding** of each part of the technology stack. 
Increasingly interested in solving **UI/UX challenges**, I can dive-in and specialize as needed to build **thoughtful** and **robust solutions**.

## 💻🛠
I have a lot of experience with Python, Django and the AWS stack on the backend, and with SvelteJS, TypeScript and HTML-CSS on the frontend, but I am a quick learner and can **apply my knowledge** of the craft to any language, framework and technological stack.

## 👏🤝
I am a **team-player**, and always look forward to **cross-training** opportunities, **technical discussions** and **strategic conversations** to make the most of **every team member**'s input.

## 🗺📍
After a 9-year career in healthcare technology in the **US**, I have relocated to **France** and am looking for my next adventure!
Primarily searching for **on-site jobs** in **Centre-Val de Loire**, I stay open to interesting **remote** and **hybrid** opportunities on **meaningful** projects.
